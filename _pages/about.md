My first real passions were poetry and art. During my first years of high school I used to spend hours inside of art museums everyday during summer, maybe even looking at just a couple of paintings.
Studying art allowed me to discover Leonardo. Studying Leonardo allowed me to discover robotics. Studying robotics allowed me to discover my future.

I'm a senior undergraduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology in Mechanical Engineering, minoring in both robotics and bio-inspired design, as well as an undergraduate researcher at Daniel I. Goldman's CRAB Lab. My research interest is Bio-inspired Robotics. Currently I am mainly working on complex-terrain multilegged robotic locomotion, but in general I am interested in exploratory/search-and-rescue robotics.

In summer 2023 I was a research intern at Roland Siegwart's Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich, working on the underwater robotics startup Tethys Robotics.
In summer 2022 I was a research intern ad Domenico Prattichizzo's SIRSLab at Siena University, working on robotic haptic applications.
